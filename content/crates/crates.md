Games have started doing a thing where you spend real money, and you get a crate of items, characters, in-game currency, etc. And players mostly hate it. But does it have to be so bad?

# Levels of Hell

Different implementations have different levems of scorn thrown at publishers.

EA's Starwars Battlefront 2 seems to be one of the worst offenders right now. Unlocking characters is tediously slow, or unreasonably expensive and luck-based. And EA's response to the complaints earned them a record-setting 600k downvotes

Valve added loot crates to TF2 ages ago. They had non-cosmetic items, but they don't seem to have taken too much flak for it because the game had already been turned into a war-themed hat simulator in previous patches, and the basic gameplay is still fun without the items. It was added as a way to monetize a dying game

Overwatch seems to have kicked off the recent trend. They're annoying, but they give no competitive advantage, which limits the complaints. There complants are usually from people that want one particular item, and have to spend an unknown, probably large amount to guarantee they get it

# Sins

The things players hate about loot crates fall into a few categories:

- feeling like richer players are leaving them behind
- feeling ripped off after opening crates
- worry about gambling addiction
- paying real money for virtual things

I'm going to ignore the last one, since anybody with those complaints is going to be resistent to buying a game in the first place

Feeling like they have to keep paying more to keep up is probably the quickest way to get players to hate your game. Especially if they paid for the game itself, and now they feel like the publisher owes them $60 worth of fun, and getting beat by some jerk who bought a bigger gun than you isn't much fun. And there's always someone that spent more than you

Second is feeling like they got a bad deal. This comes in a few forms: low expected value (they got a bubblegum wrapper and a shoelace. next crate, they got a potato. every 100 crates or so, they get an okay tshirt), the loot isn't valuable to them (they wanted a bowtie, but got a monacle. the monacle is nice, but their vision is fine and they can't trade it easily), or the variance is high (every 1000 or so crates, they get A NEW CAR!, but up until then it's all bottlecaps and dryer lint, and maybe the occasional fidget spinner). This makes players feel like they're suckers when they buy crates, and then they'll hate the publisher for suggesting they buy them. Plus, they won't want to buy them as much

They won't buy them without the gambling aspect, anyway. People see this as publishers exploiting flaws in the human mind in order to trick players into parting with their money. This is amplified if you can somehow exchange in-game loot for actual money, but also games fall under more strict gambling laws in many countries if that's the case

And a final sin, that mostly goes unmentioned: crates encourage devs/publishers to make games that take too bloody long to play. if you can finish the game in 3 hours (or even 30), who is going to stick around long enough to buy a crate?

# Redemption

There are a some good things about loot crates, if they could overcome the downsides:

- developer/publisher can make money off the game
- it's sorta a pay-what-you-want model
- opening crates is fun
- longevity is a bonus in multiplayer games, so you have people to play with

So, what would crates look like if they were fair?

Overwatch is almost there in China, where they were legally required to change how crates work due to gambling laws. Instead of selling loot crates, they sell in-game currency, and give you a bonus loot crate with each purchase. That effectively lowers the variance, and makes it easier to get the things you actually want, rather than be totally at the whims of the crate gods. They also tell you the probabilities.

Here's a proposal for a loot crate system that isn't awful:

- have in-game currency
- you can buy crates with it
- you can buy anything in a crate with it
- a 100 credit crate should have, say, 200 credits worth of stuff in it
- allowing re-rolls or a drafting-like mechanic could help
- have different crates with different loot distributions
- loot distributions should be public
- items can increase options, but not power
- cosmetic items preferred

on non-cosmetic items:

- unlocking a new things should happen as you get bored of last one
- unlocking characters is great, because you can only play one at a time
- unlocking skills is good if you can only have a few at once
- deep skill trees mean people buy their way to the top. not good
- buying higher numbers is basically always bad
- no super rare things that basically only high rollers will have
- maps/leves are terrible because they fragment playerbase

on cosmetic things:

- have matching sets, so if you randomly get 2 pieces, you'll want to buy the 3rd
- things should still be recognizable
- veblen goods are okay
- have some paid-only things, for people to show that they paid
- have some skill-gated things, for people to show they're skilled
- have some limited-time things, for people to show they've been here a while
