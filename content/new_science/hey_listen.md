Summary: listening to recursive sequences from wolfram's "A New Kind of Science"
Status: draft

I started reading Stephen Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science" a few days ago, and when i got to [page 130](http://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p130--recursive-sequences/), I thought, "hey, those look like audio".

So I wrote a [c program]() to turn a few of them into wav files: [c](new_science/c.wav), [e](new_science/e.wav), [f](new_science/f.wav)
