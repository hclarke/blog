Summary: i've been watching you

i've been watching you for years.</br>
i keep looking over to see if you're looking back.</br>
you show fleeting interest, every once in a while</br>
i follow your footprints back, longing to see where you've been</br>
what could i do, to entice you away from the others?</br>
i watch as you leave, wishing i knew what to say to make you stay</br>

for both of us, i've decided to [stop](https://github.com/hclarke/blog/commit/9e906fa890863c914452f5d36286cd089179f332)
